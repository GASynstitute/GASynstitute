## 🏷️ About Me

- **Name/Handle**: GASynstitute (pronounced “G-A Syn Sti Tute”)  
- **Day Job**: IT Windows Server Administrator & Cloud Explorer  
  - Managing SMEs’ infrastructure: Windows Server, Exchange 2019, Hyper-V, Cisco Meraki, Azure AD, Intune, and more.  
  - Love automating one-off tasks into repeatable scripts (PowerShell is my lab partner!).  
- **Passions & Side Quests**:  
  - 📈 **Futures Trading**: Chart patterns, Fibonacci levels, ATR, and the ever-thrilling NQ scalp hunt.  
  - 🧠 **Thought-Flipping Theory**: Challenging assumptions, exploring creative perspectives, and applying sparring techniques to tech, business, and even the military-industrial complex.  
- **Fun Fact**:  
  - I once made 90+ trades on a single NQ contract in one day, swinging from –\$900 to +\$450 and back to +\$200. My heart rate could write its own blog post!
